My name is Spencer Salazar. 
I am a doctoral student at [Stanford CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu), a lead developer for [ChucK](http://chuck.stanford.edu), and a sometime software engineer. 
This is my blog, in which I share tidbits of ChucK programming and general thoughts on digital aesthetics.
